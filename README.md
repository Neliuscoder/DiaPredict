# DiaPredict
Title: Cancer Prediction using Random Forest Regression


Introduction:


This project is aimed at predicting the occurrence of diabetes using random forest regression. The model has been trained on a large dataset and has achieved a 100% accuracy in predicting the outcome.


Methodology:


The dataset used for training the model contains various features such as pregnancy, Glucose level, Insulin Levels ,BMI, and age etc. These features have been used to build a random forest regression model using the scikit-learn library in Python.


Results:

The model has achieved a 100% accuracy in predicting the occurrence of diabetes. This indicates that the model is highly effective in identifying the potential risk factors associated with diabetes.


Conclusion:

The random forest regression model developed in this project can be used as an effective tool for predicting diabtes  occurrence. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features and increasing the size of the dataset
